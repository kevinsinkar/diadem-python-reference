# IChannel.ChannelGroup

!!! abstract "Property &middot; `DataPlugin.chm`"
    Property: ChannelGroup for Channel <DataPlugin>

!!! note "Context: DataPlugin script"
    Examples in this section run inside DIAdem's **DataPlugin host**
    context, where identifiers like `Root`, `File`, `oBlock`, and
    related host-supplied objects resolve automatically. From standalone
    external Python via `Dispatch("DIAdem.TOCmd")` those names raise
    `NameError`. The DataPlugin API is intended to be used by writing
    your script inside a `.uri` DataPlugin file that DIAdem then loads;
    it is not directly callable from external Python.

Specifies the channel group to which a channel is assigned.

## Signature

```python
return_value = obj.ChannelGroup
```

## Python example

!!! warning "Machine-translated"
    The original DIAdem topic did not include a Python tab; this
    example was machine-translated from the VBScript source.

```python
for i in range(1, Root.ChannelGroups.Count + 1):
    for oMyChn in Root.ChannelGroups(i).Channels:
        if oMyChn.Name == "Temp":
            MsgBoxDisp(oMyChn.ChannelGroup.Name)
```
